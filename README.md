Loan approval is the legal use of a bank account by someone who is eligible to repay a loan.
Acceptance of a loan is a crucial step for financial organisations. The system either accepts or rejects
loan applications. Loan recovery is an important aspect of a bank's financial performance. It's
impossible to predict if the borrower will be able to repay the loan. In recent years, several scholars
have started working on loan approval prediction systems. When dealing with massive amounts of
data, machine learning (ML) algorithms are quite useful for predicting outcomes. To forecast
customer loan acceptance, two machine learning algorithms are applied in this study: Logistic
Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF).</br></br>

## Project Objective
**Using machine learning approaches, which allow computers to learn from data and forecast
bank loan acceptance.**</br>
**To use an existing dataset to train the model**</br>
**To investigate and implement optimal Logistics Regression Models and Random Forest
Models into our project.**</br>
**To put the model to the test and see how accurate it is as well as the rate of precision.**</br>
**To create a machine learning algorithm that works with the right dataset**
</br></br>

## Model Objective 
**To assist banks in detecting incidences of loan to be wrong handed.**</br>
**To be able to correlate characteristics (such as Loan status) that contribute to the approval
of a bank loan application.**</br>
**To use machine learning techniques to increase the accuracy of loan approval prediction as
much as feasible with the supplied data set.**
</br></br>

From our model, Random Forest had the best quality of both, which is 98%. Logistic Regression
calculations confirmed the accuracy of 79%, which is quite low of the precision of Random Forest.
So, we can choose Random Forest for prediction using new datasets yet to come.
